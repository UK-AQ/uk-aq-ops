# UK-AQ station history Worker

`uk-aq-station-history` is a private Service Binding Worker. It has no public route; `uk-aq-cache-proxy` retains browser authentication, CORS, bypass authorization, and public cache ownership.

## Station-series source policy

`GET /v1/station-series` resolves the authoritative timeseries identity before reading data. It performs exactly one logical recent observation read directly from the ingest database through `uk_aq_public.rpc/uk_aq_timeseries_rpc`, using the smallest supported RPC window that covers the required source interval. A required interval beyond the RPC's 30-day maximum is marked incomplete rather than treated as direct-source coverage. It never calls the stitched public `uk_aq_timeseries` Edge Function.

A request uses ingest-only mode only when the direct response covers the complete requested output, the requested end, and any PM 23-hour AQI context. Otherwise the same direct result is reused with bounded R2 sources:

- R2 AQI is authoritative over live AQI for the same canonical hour.
- R2 observations are authoritative over direct ingest observations for the same exact timestamp within the configured 1–3 hour overlap.
- Live AQI is calculated only for R2-missing eligible hours, using the shared AQI library.
- AQI and observation historical boundaries and completeness states remain independent.

Partial or gap-bearing responses use `Cache-Control: no-store`. Diagnostics report counts, boundaries, RPC window/HTTP attempt metadata, completeness, and overlap/mismatch totals but never observation values.

## index_v3 observation-history paging

When `UK_AQ_R2_HISTORY_INDEX_VERSION=v3`, station-history uses the selected
shared exact-leaf reader through the authenticated observation-history client.
The browser and cache proxy continue to use the existing station-history
routes and response shape; neither receives nor returns a `physical_cursor`.

The R2 observation adapter:

- splits every required physical-timeseries interval at UTC-day boundaries,
  so each low-level logical request is no more than 24 hours;
- issues the first exact-leaf request, then follows
  `physical_page.next_cursor` until that logical piece is complete;
- appends pages and UTC pieces in strict chronological order;
- shares one invocation-scoped read budget across all continuity members and
  compatibility phases, capped at 16 physical pages and the existing 5,000
  station-history observation rows; and
- preserves the exact-leaf reader's one-segment/1,024-row invocation bound,
  pinned object identities, exact stored byte ranges, and fail-closed cursor
  validation.

The existing maximum seven-day observation chunk plus 23 hours of PM context
can intersect at most nine UTC days. Normal hourly and current five-minute
sources therefore fit comfortably inside 16 pages. The budget also stays
below the current external-subrequest limit and would produce at most 19
Worker invocations in the full cache-proxy -> station-history ->
observation-history chain if the leaf client later moves to a Service Binding.

If page 16 still has work remaining, station-history stops with
`observation_history_physical_page_budget_exceeded`. If appending a physical
page would take the invocation above its row budget, that page is not appended
and station-history stops with `observation_history_row_budget_exceeded`.
Neither case exposes a browser continuation or claims completeness. Both flow
through the existing incomplete-response `Cache-Control: no-store` policy.

The historical response `limits.max_pages` field retains its established v2
meaning. A v3 physical-page response instead reports
`limits.max_physical_pages: 16`.

The shelved encrypted, browser-visible station-history continuation candidate
and its cap experiments are retained under
`archive/2026-09-02/index_v3_station_history_continuation/`. That design is
separate from the active private low-level `physical_cursor`.

## AQI v2 endpoint response contract

The active R2 v2 AQI path uses `timestamp_hour_utc = n` as its canonical
hour-ending endpoint. Station-series AQI sections and older AQI chunks expose
`response_contract: "aqi_hour_interval_v2"`; each AQI row carries both
`timestamp_hour_utc` and `period_end_utc`, each equal to `n`.

During the additive compatibility release, `period_start_utc` remains the
legacy endpoint alias. It must not be interpreted as a true start by a
consumer that has not first selected `period_end_utc` or `timestamp_hour_utc`.
The coordinated final contract will set the true period start to `n - 1 hour`.
The represented interval is therefore documented as `(n - 1 hour, n]`; this
Worker does not change stored R2 v2 data, writers, manifests, indexes or
metadata.

`/v1/aqi-history` is an internal HTTP route version, not R2 history v1. The
private Service Binding architecture and R2-over-live precedence are unchanged.

## Configuration

Required data-path values:

- `SUPABASE_URL` and `SB_SECRET_KEY` for authoritative identity lookup and direct recent-observation RPC calls.
- `UK_AQ_AQI_HISTORY_R2_API_URL`, `UK_AQ_OBSERVS_HISTORY_R2_API_URL`, and `UK_AQ_EDGE_UPSTREAM_SECRET` for R2 fallback/history.
- `UK_AQ_PUBLIC_SCHEMA` (default `uk_aq_public`) and `INGESTDB_RETENTION_DAYS` (default `5`).

Optional TEST tuning uses safe in-code defaults when absent:

- `UK_AQ_STATION_HISTORY_STABLE_AQI_HEAD_MAX_HOURS` (`168`).
- `UK_AQ_STATION_HISTORY_AQI_CHUNK_MAX_HOURS` (`744`).
- `UK_AQ_STATION_HISTORY_OBSERVATION_CHUNK_MAX_HOURS` (`168`).
- `UK_AQ_STATION_HISTORY_OBSERVATION_OVERLAP_HOURS` (`2`, validated to `1`–`3`).
- `UK_AQ_STATION_HISTORY_OBSAQIDB_TIMEOUT_MS` (`10000`).

The index_v3 physical-page budget is a fixed safety bound, not an environment
variable or public pagination control.
