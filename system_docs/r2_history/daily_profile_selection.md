# Integrity daily profile date selection

## Authority and scope

This document defines the authoritative UTC date-selection contract for the scheduled Integrity `daily` profile.

The implementation is owned by:

- `scripts/uk-aq-history-integrity/bin/daily_profile.py`
- `scripts/uk-aq-history-integrity/bin/uk-aq-history-integrity.py`

This document covers how the daily profile chooses dates and the narrow pre-boundary work permitted to construct that scope. Source acquisition, connector checks, repair planning and repair execution remain governed by [`integrity.md`](integrity.md), [`history_writer_coordination.md`](history_writer_coordination.md) and [`implementation_safety_contract.md`](implementation_safety_contract.md).

Where active date-selection code differs from this document, this document is authoritative and the code must be brought into line before relying on the scheduled profile.

## Discovery source

The daily profile discovers available observation dates from the local Dropbox mirror of the active committed v2 observations tree.

It inspects only direct child directories whose names strictly match:

```text
history/v2/observations/day_utc=YYYY-MM-DD
```

Staging paths, overlays, archives, other history versions and malformed day-directory names do not participate in selection.

Date discovery is performed at the top-level observations-day boundary. It does not inspect connector directories before deciding whether a date or month is represented.

## Pre-boundary scope construction

Automatic daily selection must construct its exact requested date set before the request-wide earliest-IngestDB-day boundary can be evaluated.

Before that boundary check, the daily profile may perform only:

1. direct child-name enumeration under the configured local Dropbox mirror path for `history/v2/observations`;
2. strict parsing of `day_utc=YYYY-MM-DD` names;
3. latest-day and represented-month calculation from those names;
4. reads from the local Integrity SQLite `daily_profile_state` table needed to calculate missed logical-date catch-up;
5. calculation and de-duplication of recent, historical and catch-up dates and their reasons;
6. derivation of the selected request's minimum and maximum UTC dates.

This is a narrow scope-discovery exception. It is not Dropbox readiness, comparison or validation.

Before the boundary passes, daily selection must not:

- inspect connector or pollutant child directories;
- open, parse, hash or validate Dropbox manifests, Parquet or other history objects;
- run general Dropbox freshness, inventory, placeholder or completeness checks;
- inspect or acquire authoritative source files;
- read live R2;
- create findings or repair proposals;
- mark the current logical date `complete`;
- mark missed logical dates `caught_up`.

After the exact selected date set is known, Integrity must run the request-wide boundary check for the complete requested connector set. Normal Dropbox readiness and every later Integrity stage begin only after that check succeeds.

If no valid exact selection can be constructed, the daily run fails before the boundary rather than inventing a date range.

## Latest day and recent window

The newest discovered observations day becomes `latest_r2_observations_day`.

The recent part of the daily profile is the seven consecutive UTC calendar dates ending on that day:

```text
latest_r2_observations_day - 6 days
through
latest_r2_observations_day
```

Each date in that seven-day range is selected even when its own top-level R2 day directory is missing. This allows Integrity to detect and repair a missing day inside an otherwise represented recent range.

The daily profile does not infer or select dates after `latest_r2_observations_day`. A manual scoped run or another writer must first establish a later committed observations day before the scheduled profile advances beyond the current latest day.

Because discovery uses the committed local Dropbox mirror rather than live R2, a run using an older mirror, including one allowed through `--allow-stale-dropbox`, remains anchored to the latest day visible in that mirror until a newer successful Dropbox backup is available.

## Historical month representation

A historical year/month is represented when at least one strictly parsed top-level observations day directory exists in that month and the month is earlier than the month containing `latest_r2_observations_day`.

Month representation is global across the observations tree:

- any connector can cause a month to be represented;
- representation is not calculated separately for each connector;
- the particular day that caused the month to be represented does not constrain the historical date selected within that month.

For every represented historical month, the profile constructs the date allocated to the current logical UTC run date. The constructed date is selected when it is a valid date in that historical month, whether or not that exact date already exists in R2.

For example, assume January 2025 contains only:

```text
history/v2/observations/day_utc=2025-01-31
```

If January 2025 is earlier than the latest represented month and the logical run is on day 1 of a month, the daily profile selects:

```text
2025-01-01
```

This remains true when the existing 31 January directory contains data for only one connector. That connector makes January 2025 represented for the global date-selection stage. Connector and source scope are applied later when Integrity checks the selected date.

If January 2025 is itself the latest represented month, it is not treated as a historical month. The profile instead selects the seven-day recent window ending on the latest discovered January date.

## Historical day-number allocation

The logical run date is UTC. Across each logical calendar month, historical day numbers 1 through 31 are allocated exactly once:

- logical days 1 through 25 select the same historical day number;
- in a 31-day logical month, days 26 through 31 also select the same day number;
- in a 30-day logical month, day 30 selects historical day numbers 30 and 31;
- in a 29-day February, day 28 selects 28 and 30, and day 29 selects 29 and 31;
- in a 28-day February, day 26 selects 26 and 29, day 27 selects 27 and 30, and day 28 selects 28 and 31.

A historical target is skipped only when that constructed calendar date is invalid for the represented historical month. For example, a selected historical day number 31 is skipped for April.

## Missed logical-date catch-up

The daily profile uses the local Integrity SQLite `daily_profile_state` table to recover historical allocations belonging to UTC logical run dates that did not complete successfully.

Catch-up is calculated separately for each Integrity environment:

1. If the environment has no daily-profile state rows, the feature starts from the current logical date. It deliberately does not invent catch-up work for dates before the feature was first used.
2. Otherwise, Integrity finds the latest logical date whose state is `complete` or `caught_up`.
3. Starting with the following UTC date and ending on the day before the current logical run date, any date with no state row, or whose state is not `complete` or `caught_up`, is treated as missed.
4. If state rows exist but none is complete or caught up, the scan starts from the earliest recorded logical date.
5. For each missed logical date, Integrity calculates that date's historical day-number allocation using the rules above and adds the corresponding dates in every represented historical month to the current selection.

Catch-up recovers the historical day-of-month allocations that a missed daily profile would have contributed. It does **not** replay a separate seven-day recent window for every missed logical date. The current run always contributes one recent seven-day window, recalculated from the latest observations day visible in the chosen Dropbox mirror.

The recent dates, current historical allocations and catch-up historical allocations are combined and de-duplicated. A selected date may retain more than one reason, including `recent`, `historical:<day-number>` and `catch_up:<missed-logical-date>:<day-number>`.

Catch-up state is cleared only by a successful real daily repair run:

- the current logical date is marked `complete` only when a non-dry-run `--run-backfill` daily profile finishes with overall status `ok`;
- only after that completion are the included missed logical dates marked `caught_up` and linked to the completing Integrity run;
- a dry run is recorded as `dry_run` and does not clear catch-up work;
- failed, stopped, skipped or otherwise incomplete daily runs do not clear catch-up work, so those logical dates remain eligible for a later daily profile.

Pre-boundary daily-profile state reads are read-only. No state transition is permitted until the boundary has passed and the normal run reaches its documented completion outcome.

## Connector and source scope

Daily date selection is global and happens before connector-specific checking.

The selected dates do not imply that every connector is expected to exist on every selected day. After selection, Integrity applies the requested source, connector and pollutant scope and evaluates each relevant connector according to its authoritative source and mapping contract.

For example, running the daily profile with `--source sos` uses the same global recent, historical and catch-up date selection, but only the SOS connector scope is acquired, checked and, when requested, repaired.

The date-selection stage must not become connector-specific unless this system contract is deliberately changed.

The request-wide boundary check nevertheless uses the complete connector set implied by the requested source or connector scope. A boundary failure blocks the entire selected daily request.

## Empty discovery and audit evidence

The daily profile must fail rather than invent a calendar range when no strictly parsed committed v2 observations day directories are discovered.

The run evidence records at least:

- the logical UTC run date and its source;
- `latest_r2_observations_day`;
- the recent start and end dates;
- the allocated historical day numbers;
- the number of represented historical months;
- every selected date and its selection reason;
- each catch-up logical date included in the selection;
- whether catch-up completion occurred;
- each logical date marked `caught_up` by the completing run;
- the persisted state-row status for the current logical date;
- whether only permitted scope discovery occurred before the boundary;
- the request-wide boundary result for every requested connector.
